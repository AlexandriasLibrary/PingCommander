# PingCommander
A functional powershell script template to ping various devices throughout a network.

It works by offering a selection of octets and prompts to ping a specified group of devices within cmd windows.

This tool is a publicly available iteration of a tool I created for a major retail chain for tier 1 network support.

## Intentions
This script can be fully customized to fit the needs of home networks, retail locations, offices, internal networks, remote servers, etc.

Simply follow the notes and alter any octets as-needed to customize it to your needs.

### Executable Option
If you would like to save time and make launching it simpler for users, you can turn it into an executable program. I reccomend using [PS2EXE](https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE) personally. 

If you want to take it one step further, you can make a **.ico** image with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or something similar to make a recognizable icon for the program. I suggest using your company logo or something representative of network equipment for easy recognition by staff.

Due to the custom nature of this project as well as security purposes I do not and will never distribute an .exe version of this program. Only use an .exe version of this program if it is generated and approved by yourself and/or your appropriate colleagues.

**This script is free and not intended to be sold, purchased or redistributed for money in any iteration. You may use it for professional use within those restrictions.**
